These are PREDB dumps for nZEDb, they are created daily.
Every file only contains the last 24 hours of PRE's.
The number in the file name is the unix time when the file was created.
The newest dump will have the largest number, so it will be at the bottom.

Github API only returns 1000 files, so the files are put into folders, up to 300.

You can batch import these using this script:
